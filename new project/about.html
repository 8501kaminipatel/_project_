            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <b>Common Deer: Make it Better.</b>
            <p>We're a small business dedicated to helping other small businesses thrive. Championing makers, artists, and domestic goods leads to a strong, fair economy that prioritizes people and planet over profits.
              The 500+ brands that we work with drive our economy forward from the ground up. We believe in a data-mce-fragment="1">rising tide lifts all boats Your choice to support products made locally matters. By giving gifts with story, you not only brighten a day, but you also share your values and make an impact on a community. Join us in celebrating goods made here, and together, let's make it better.
              <p>So, what's the deal with "it" in make it better? Well, that's a bit of a mystery, on purpose. Just like our name, our mission's meaning is all over the place. We're not trying to be confusing, but we want people to think about what we're doing and why. It's like a puzzle that you get to solve. </p>
              <p>But here’s what we think about “it”:</p>
              <b>Make THE ECONOMY better</b>
              <p>Wanna make the world a better place? Support local products, not mass-produced stuff from overseas! Local production means less transportation, which equals fewer carbon emissions from shipping across the ocean. Plus, local businesses tend to be smaller, so they can focus on sustainable practices, reduce waste, and follow stricter production and pollution control standards. Plus, we think it’s a safe bet that products made locally are less likely to end up in a landfill and have a longer life. By supporting local businesses, you're helping create a more environmentally-friendly way of making and using stuff. It's a win-win for the planet and your community!</p>
              <b>Make it better FOR WORKERS:</b>
              <p> When you buy locally made goods, you're basically giving makers and artists the thumbs up to keep doing what they love, whether it's making cool art or crafting handmade stuff. Plus, buying local encourages these makers to aim for the best because they know you appreciate their hard work. As a result, you get high-quality products made with extra care because the makers take pride in what they do and want to make it even better.&nbsp;</p>
              <b>Make YOUR DAY better:</b>
              <p> Let's face it, finding awesome products is a total blast! Shopping can sometimes get a bad rep, but we think of our shop as a place to have a good time. Who doesn't love checking out cool stuff, especially when you know that each purchase supports someone's passion? Even if you're not too concerned about the impact of your purchase, browsing our collection is just plain fun. Whether you're scrolling through our digital shelves or getting the chance to shop in person, there's no need to overcomplicate it - just enjoy it! Ps. there’s lots more than just buying things that can improve your day - so of course, buying things shouldn’t be the ONLY thing that tickles your fancy, but hey we’re here for you if it does.&nbsp;</p>
              <b>Make THEIR DAY better:</b>
              <p> We're all about making your special someone's day with gifts that mean something. We know how amazing it feels to receive a thoughtful gift, so we're here to help you find the perfect present for any occasion. Our carefully chosen collection has something for everyone. And guess what? By picking gifts that support artists and makers, you're not just making their day but also showing off your commitment to making a difference. Let us help you make an impact with your gift.&nbsp;</p>
              <b>KEEPING OUR SMALL BUSINESS STRONG TOO&nbsp;</b>
              <p>We love supporting makers and artists and helping you discover your next favorite thing. But, let's be real, we need your support to keep doing our thing. We can't keep celebrating the talented folks we feature or continue buying products from your favorite brands without you. So, think of us as like a permanent craft fair where makers aren’t giving up their weekends in order to sell stuff, but they’re able to focus on their passion: CREATING those goods!&nbsp;</p>
              <p>When you shop with us, you're not just buying a product—you're supporting a dream. You're helping a maker turn their passion into a sustainable living. You're helping an artist share their unique vision with the world. And you're helping us create a more vibrant, diversified, fair, and creative economy. With your help, we can keep our small business strong and continue celebrating artists, makers, and goods made here. Together, let’s make it better.</p>
